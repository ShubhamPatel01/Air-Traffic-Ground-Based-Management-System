# Air-Traffic-Management-System
### Introduction
This is our project which has its understanding from two topics/subjects - Programming Language like Python and SQL like SQLite or MySQL.  
    
Air traffic in this world has been increasing day by day and so as the demand for air travel. 
Increased number of flights mean increased number of air traffic, which in turn means increase in 
ruckus created at airports as many flights come and go from airport, so each flight needs to be 
given a route, parking allocation, permissions for takeoff and landing and several other ground based tasks. This all makes the job of staff of Air Traffic Control difficult and time consuming. 
Hence, for better execution of all the tasks at airport, a proper management system is necessary. 
So, we came up with the Air traffic ground-based management system for better running of airport 
as well as less load on Air Traffic Control.  
The purpose of Air traffic ground-based management system is to allow the staff of air traffic 
control to track the movements of all the flights which are coming from some place and which 
may or may not want to go to other place. There is provision for staff of ATC to enter flight details 
which are coming towards airplane and may or may not want to leave from airport for a specific 
time. It will also facilitate the staff of ATC to give permission to airplane to land at the airport, 
allocation of parking or hardstands where boarding/deboarding of passengers or loading/unloading 
of cargo will take place, guide airplanes to their allocated hardstands, again give them permission 
to move towards runway for takeoff, guide airplanes towards runway by telling directions and 
giving permissions to airplanes to takeoff. Also, there is provision for emergency landing of 
airplanes as well as provision to vie history of all planes which departed from the airport. 

### Scope
- The schedule of flights is entered by someone who just enters the details about flight like arrival 
time, departure time, aircraft ID, flight type, and some other important attributes. 
- The staff of Air Traffic Control will give permission to land, permission to taxi towards parking, 
permission to taxi towards runway and takeoff permission. 
- There will also be a provision for emergency landing of flights which needs to be landed on priority 
because of certain reasons.
- Staff will have access to the view of different terminals to see the vacancy available at different 
terminals.
- Staff can also check the recent airplanes which had taken off from the airports and the details about 
the airplanes.

### Requirements
- VS Code
- DB Browser
- Several Python Modules like - Tkinter, Datetime, PIL, IO, etc.
